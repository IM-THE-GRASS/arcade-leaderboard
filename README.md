# Arcade leadearboard
 A wesite that uses BeutifulSoup4 webscraping to grab your ticket count from your shop URL.

The site is live at https://arcade-leaderboard.reflex.run/ and has a large range of real arcade data from real participants.

## How it works:
It scapes your shop URL using the requests library and BeutifulSoup4 when anybody visits the site to get the number of tickets you have and stores the value in a MongoDB database. All the data leverages Fernet symmetric key encryption for simplicity and security.
